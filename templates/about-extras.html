				Bombur's parentage is unknown. He is the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's line, although
				he was descended from the Dwarves of Moria. His birth date is unknown, though it fell somewhere between TA 2763 and TA
				2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after Thorin was
				captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly
				150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin,
				after the loss of Thráin II.
